		<h1>Online Learning</h1>
		<h5>For Evolutionary Changemakers</h5>
		<p>Visionary leaders are leveraging their experience with online learning platforms to increase the potency of their world changing messages. Writing a book or giving a recorded talk can spread awareness about an idea, and even generate some adoption and influence some behavior. Engaging in dialog, though, has a greater capacity to facilitate growth. The seeker can pose specific concerns about their life and their projects. The teacher can encourage and correct with pinpoint sensitivity.</p>

		<p>In our passion to educate and facilitate growth, we must also stay diligent in our production and presentation of ideas and materials. What follows is an audit of Terry Patten's <a href="https://www.terrypatten.com/nrh/guide-to-being-the-change-for-real/" target="_blank">New Republic of the Heart online course landing page</a> from a previous year. Examples are also taken from other courses. We are working now to develop the 2020 course presentation and taking some time to assess past successes and areas for potential improvement.</p>

		<p>This essay not only serves to plan changes to this specific course presentation but also: <br>
			- Demonstrates applications of design thinking which can be applied to all messaging<br>
			- Gives clear examples of patterns in digital communication which could help anyone communicating broadly online<br>
			- Pays special attention to the holistic community, its values and concerns
		</p>

		 <p>I am writing this essay for those who are responsible for the promotion of thought leaders. Not everyone with this responsibility has a background in graphic design or communications, nor should they. I hope to increase clarity, though, around some very practical concepts in graphic design and typography.</p>

		<h3 class="body-text">Typographic Torts</h3>

		<p class="body-text section-heading"><strong>Quote Marks</strong></p>
		<p class="body-text">Some words and phrases are more "special" than others. Okay, so how does that sentence feel? The quotation marks have to go. I'll let a few <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DqoQq1zME8" target="_blank">limey comedians</a> explain this one.</p>

		<p class="body-text">Did you watch the video? Seriously, watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DqoQq1zME8" target="_blank">video</a>. It is quite funny. Now, if you think that it doesn't apply, try to read the second paragraph in section four, Getting Real. Read it aloud and account for the implied differences in inflection signaled by the bold, italic, and quoted spans of text. Did you have three different inflections?</p> 

		<img class="body-image" src="img/getting-real.jpg" alt="section four, getting real" nopin="nopin">

		<p class="body-text">Here's why it doesn't work: Text in bold, sometimes in caps (which is mostly a mistake) is emphasized by raising our voice — which implies intensity. For italics, we lower our voice — which implies acknowledgment of a tangentially related statement or qualifier. To sound sarcastic we slow our voices down and maybe change tone a little. Increased speed isn't used to imply semantic meaning; it just makes you sound nervous. Now, a lot could be said about the fact that English uses its limited tonality to confer intensity, distraction, and sarcasm and that this is more or less the whole palette of modifiers to tone that we need to communicate. Another time.</p>

		<p class="body-text">It is sufficient for now that this is our palette, <em>in English at least</em>. And when you put quotes around a word or phrase, without attributing it to someone or a specific reference, it will generally relate sarcasm or irony. Deviation from this norm is communicatively and cognitively expensive. What's worse, it is an expense which one demands the reader to bear with them. That's not cool.</p>

		<p class="body-text section-heading"><strong>Repeatable Symbols</strong></p>
		<p class="body-text">[ What we can gain by making symbols out of recurring content. ]</p>

		<img class="body-image" src="img/session-3.jpg" alt="before shot of session three" nopin="nopin">

		<p class="body-text">[ Description of improvements shown below — <em>as soon as they happen</em> ]</p>

		<img class="body-image" src="img/session-3-better.jpg" alt="after shot of session three" nopin="nopin">

		<p class="body-text section-heading"><strong>Semantic Spacing</strong></p>
		<p class="body-text"><em>I made a mini-tutorial about this design principle which can&nbsp;be&nbsp;found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3WENj3lIuP/" target="_stuff">here</a> .</em></p>
		<p class="body-text">Headings, even smaller ones, should use <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/nonbreaking-spaces.html" target="_stuff">non-breaking spaces</a> between last few words to prevent <a href="http://www.magazinedesigning.com/typographic-widows-and-orphans/" target="_stuff">orphaned words</a>. The below wouldn't pass for acceptable typesetting in print and should not be considered acceptable typesetting in a digital publication:</p>

		<img class="body-image" src="img/orphans.jpg" alt="orphaned words" nopin="nopin">

		<p class="body-text">Place a <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/line-length.html" target="_stuff">max-width attribute</a> rule on all paragraph and list elements. Those line lengths are just unruly.</p>

		<p class="body-text">Eliminate equal spacing between non-peers. This is covered a bit more in the area on the course sessions, later on. It is also addressed in the slides of the aforementioned <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3WENj3lIuP/" target="_stuff">mini-tutorial.</a></p>

		<h3 class="body-text">Content Concerns</h3>

		<p class="body-text section-heading"><strong>Desired Outcomes</strong></p>
		<p class="body-text">Overall there is a lot of language addressing how the participant will be affected which specific attributes of themselves which will be changed and some affirmations about integration of inner and outer work. The outer work, though, feels less specifically addressed in terms of application and outcome.</p>

		<p class="body-text section-heading"><strong>Flowery Language</strong></p>
		<p class="body-text">[ With flowery language, one idea per sentence. Always follow with something concrete. Doing otherwise should be reserved for occasions of intentional exclusion. ]</p>

		<p class="body-text">[ Unpacking the sentence:<br> "Each week, we’ll read and discuss a new chapter, <strong>engaging it at the level of our embodied, awakened consciousness and intending to live the questions in community with fellow global citizens and planetary activists</strong>." <br>
			- affinity signaling, needed<br>
			- jargon, maybe/maybe not<br>
			- solution for that conflict, short sentence pairs
		]</p>

		<img class="body-image" src="img/value-density.jpg" alt="value density diagram" nopin="nopin">

		<p class="body-text">[ See that recurring green/red pair? That's solid gold. ]</p>

		<p class="body-text">[ Values I'm seeing signaled in the present language … ]</p>

		<p class="body-text">[ Risks I'm seeing … ]</p>

		<p class="body-text section-heading"><strong>POV CTAs<br>( point of view — calls to action )</strong></p>
		<p class="body-text">We know that when we're developing marketing copy we need to tell the reader what we're hoping they'll do. And, if we convey this information in the active voice, they'll think we really have the goods. Now, let's think about this basic principle of marketing from the perspective of holistic change makers.</p>

		<img class="body-image" src="img/marie-color.jpg" alt="Marie Forleo graphic for talk about Figureoutable Course" nopin="nopin">

		<p class="body-text">Okay, so there's a lot that we could talk about that is being done super well in the above example. We see that Marie has opted against the Ogilvy long form approach here. The whole lockup is simple and powerful. Our approach is quite different, so even the successful elements in this design may not apply to our communication. Let's look at that CTA for a second, though, I think there's something really special there.</p>

		<p class="body-text">Where we have the statement "Register Now" Marie has the statement "Yes!! Save my seat!" Aside from the difference in voice, what isn't the same about these two CTAs? "Register Now" is a command <strong>to</strong> the reader. "Yes, save my seat." <em>(as I'd prefer to punctuate it)</em> is a command <strong>from</strong> the reader. When we consider that Marie Forleo's brand and message are starkly dissimilar from Terry's, but that both teachers help people to find the strength and joy within themselves which they need to make a positive impact on the world, and think about this difference in CTA style in those terms — <em>well</em> — I think the case makes itself. If we are facilitators of empowerment we should be building point-of-view calls-to-action into our interfaces, interactive elements that aren't telling people what to do but rather offering them opportunities to tell us, <em>really the website itself</em>, what to do.</p>

		<h3 class="body-text">Color Correction</h3>

		<p class="body-text">The color scheme feels a little off. Here is a very simple breakdown of the gross styling components of the sites color, image treatment, and type schemes.</p>

		<img class="body-image" src="img/colors.jpg" alt="color chart of 2018 NRTH course" nopin="nopin">

		<p class="body-text">The first two colors are very similar. Generally, I would find that to be a flaw. [no distinct color hierarchy]</p>

		<p class="body-text">[ seems like the scheme is torn between being vibrant and being relaxing ]</p>

		<hr>


		<h3 class="body-text">§1 Hero/Splash Section</h3>

		<p class="body-text">Graphic design, and typography especially, is concerned with conveying information in the smoothest form possible. If I hand you a bunch of kale and say, "eat this." It is a difficult ask. If I throw that same head of kale in a Vita-Mix with a fistful of dates for a minute and pour it in a glass for you… Well, that's graphic design.</p>

		<p class="body-text">In the following image there's an optical weirdness in the visual hierarchy.</p>

		<img class="body-image" src="img/hero-section.jpg" alt="hero section from Be the Change" nopin="nopin">

		<p class="body-text">The line which comes first, "Registration for this course … " and the later line of seemingly greater size, "A New Republic of … " are set in exactly the same size and weight. The latter seems larger because it contains more capital letters. So, they are incredibly similar in their demand for attention.</p>

		<p class="body-text">Why does this matter? Well, when a person is directed to look at an advertisement of any kind they need to know where to start. Unlike a page in the middle of a novel somewhere where one just starts at the top left and it's convenient that all of the words are the same size, graphical displays often — for many good reasons — do not flow from top to bottom and from left to right. Therefor the first responsibility of a designer is to give someone a clear place to start.</p>

		<p class="body-text">[ Two different subjects which typographically look the same ]</p>

		<p class="body-text">[ Only using the font-size attribute to distinguish blocks of text makes for poor conveyance of semantic distinction between messages. Neglected and attributes and elements include: 
			- font-weight
			- spacing
			- composition
			- background (partially)
		]</p>

		<p class="body-text">[ Insufficient distinction isn't liberating it is stressful ]</p>

		<img class="body-image" src="img/uncanny.jpg" alt="demonstration of uncanny valley" nopin="nopin">

		<p class="body-text">With the expiration notice completely removed (below), we see that there is actually a decent flow to the piece. It would still feel better if there were more typographic contrast, but overall it works much better. There's a bit of a contrast issue in the details area, but we'll address accessibility considerations a little later on. For now let's move on to some of the content issues which arise here and persist throughout the landing page.</p>

		<img class="body-image" src="img/hero-section-r.jpg" alt="hero section from Be the Change, sans expiration notice" nopin="nopin">

		<p class="body-text">[ sloppy wording, "… directly facing that …" ]</p>

		<p class="body-text">[ I know I'm really ripping this section, but it is super critical to get this right.<br> 
			- bounce and commitment.<br> 
			- pattern establishment.<br>
			- opportunity for quick decision makers

		<p class="body-text">[ In session nine, sentence one, the introductory clause is not reflected in the remaining or subsequent sentences. ]</p>

		<h3 class="body-text">§9 What's Included</h3>

		<p class="body-text">An explanation of audio and video access is given; their copy nearly identical. I know that we're toward the end of the content but that isn't any reason to either get lazy or encourage lazy reading. This sort of low production value signals a little worry in the back of the mind about how seriously the provider takes their content.</p>

		<img class="body-image" src="img/redundancy.jpg" alt="audio and video archive copy is virtually identical" nopin="nopin">

		<p class="body-text"><em>The example above is from a course offered on the Shift Network which does exactly the same thing. So, at least it's a popular mistake.</em></p>

		<p class="body-text">If you've ever received an email from a Nigerian prince, or something similar, then you know the alarm bells that can go off when a sell feels a little rushed.</p>

		<p class="body-text">It would actually be totally fine if these two notations were actually just one paragraph. That's the simplest fix and nothing is wrong with it.</p>
