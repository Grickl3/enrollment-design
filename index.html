		<h1>Online Learning</h1>
		<h5>For Evolutionary Changemakers</h5>
		<p>Visionary leaders are leveraging their experience with online learning platforms to increase the potency of their world changing messages. Writing a book or giving a recorded talk can spread awareness about an idea, and even generate some adoption and influence some behavior. Engaging in dialog, though, has a greater capacity to facilitate growth. The seeker can pose specific concerns about their life and their projects. The teacher can encourage and correct with pinpoint sensitivity.</p>

		<p>In our passion to educate and facilitate growth, we must also stay diligent in our production and presentation of ideas and materials. What follows is an audit of Terry Patten's New Republic of the Heart online course landing page from a previous year. Examples are also taken from other courses. We are working now to develop the 2020 course presentation and taking some time to assess past successes and areas for potential improvement.</p>

		<p>This essay not only serves to plan changes to this specific course presentation but also: 
			- application of design thinking which can be applied to all messaging
			- clear examples of patterns in digital communication which could help anyone communicating broadly online.
			- special attention to the holistic community and its considerations
		</p>

		 <p>I am writing this essay for those who are responsible for the promotion of thought leaders. Not everyone with this responsibility has a background in graphic design or communications, nor should they. I hope to increase clarity, though, around some very practical concepts in graphic design and typography.</p>

		<p class="body-text">[ Some words and phrases are more "special" than others. Okay, so how does that sentence feel? The quotation marks have to go. I'll let a few <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DqoQq1zME8" target="_blank">limey comedians</a> explain this one.]</p>

		<h3 class="body-text">Color Correction</h3>

		<p class="body-text">[ Color scheme feels a little off. ]</p>

		<img class="body-image" src="img/colors.jpg" alt="color chart of 2018 NRTH course" nopin="nopin">

		<p class="body-text">[ first two colors are very similar ]</p>

		<p class="body-text">[ seems like the scheme is torn between being vibrant and being relaxing ]</p>

		<hr>


		<h3 class="body-text">§1 Hero/Splash Section</h3>

		<p class="body-text">Graphic design, and typography especially, is concerned with conveying information in the smoothest form possible. If I hand you a bunch of kale and say, "eat this." It is a difficult ask. If I throw that same head of kale in a Vita-Mix with a fistful of dates for a minute and pour it in a glass for you… Well, that's graphic design.</p>

		<p class="body-text">In the following image there's an optical weirdness in the visual hierarchy.</p>

		<img class="body-image" src="img/hero-section.jpg" alt="hero section from Be the Change" nopin="nopin">

		<p class="body-text">The line which comes first, "Registration for this course … " and the later line of seemingly greater size, "A New Republic of … " are set in exactly the same size and weight. The latter seems larger because it contains more capital letters. So, they are incredibly similar in their demand for attention.</p>

		<p class="body-text">Why does this matter? Well, when a person is directed to look at an advertisement of any kind they need to know where to start. Unlike a page in the middle of a novel somewhere where one just starts at the top left and it's convenient that all of the words are the same size, graphical displays often — for many good reasons — do not flow from top to bottom and from left to right. Therefor the first responsibility of a designer is to give someone a clear place to start.</p>

		<p class="body-text">[ Two different subjects which typographically look the same ]</p>

		<p class="body-text">[ Only using the font-size attribute to distinguish blocks of text makes for poor conveyance of semantic distinction between messages. Neglected and attributes and elements include: 
			- font-weight
			- spacing
			- composition
			- background (partially)
		]</p>

		<p class="body-text">[ Insufficient distinction isn't liberating it is stressful ]</p>

		<img class="body-image" src="img/uncanny.jpg" alt="demonstration of uncanny valley" nopin="nopin">

		<p class="body-text">With the expiration notice completely removed (below), we see that there is actually a decent flow to the piece. It would still feel better if there were more typographic contrast, but overall it works much better. There's a bit of a contrast issue in the details area, but we'll address accessibility considerations a little later on. For now let's move on to some of the content issues which arise here and persist throughout the landing page.</p>

		<img class="body-image" src="img/hero-section-r.jpg" alt="hero section from Be the Change, sans expiration notice" nopin="nopin">

		<p class="body-text">[ sloppy wording, "… directly facing that …" ]</p>

		<p class="body-text">[ I know I'm really ripping this section, but it is super critical to get this right.<br> 
			- bounce and commitment.<br> 
			- pattern establishment.<br>
			- opportunity for quick decision makers

		<h3 class="body-text">§7 Registration / Registration Closed</h3>
